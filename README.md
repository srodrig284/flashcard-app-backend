# Unit 11 Assignment: Cloze Constructors

### Overview

This is the backend for a basic flashcard application.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

#### Cloze Deletions

A **cloze deletion** is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed. For example, given the sentence:

_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

...We can create a "cloze deletion" by removing the words _"George Washington"_:

_"... was the first president of the United States."_
